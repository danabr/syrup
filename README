Syrup - a persistent erlang:apply_after.
========================================================================

Usage
------------------------------------------------------------------------
$ syrup:delay(5000, io, format, ["this will be printed in 5s"]).

Rationale
------------------------------------------------------------------------
syrup can be used whenever you want to do a erlang:apply:after, but also
want to make sure that delayed tasks are not lost if the node goes down.
syrup provides this by using a dets table. If the syrup server dies and
and is later started again, all remaining delayed tasks will be
rescheduled.
